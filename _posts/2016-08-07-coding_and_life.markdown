Stuck? Yes. Perfectionist? Um, yes. Like many other aspects of life, I pretty much expect myself to be an expert on everything in a week. And like many other things in life, coding just does not work that way. It takes time and effort and banging your head repeatedly up against various walls. Fun, right? 
I really am an expert at making things harder than they need to be. So I need to slow down and respect the process. Start at the beginning and get it right. Schedule time into my life to just sit down and work things out. Okay. Back to it.
