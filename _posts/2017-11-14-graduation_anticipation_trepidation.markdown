My graduation dashboard showed up yesterday. I’m looking at it with a combination of anticipation and trepidation. I still feel like so many things are code soup in my head but I am looking forward to doing this. A new career. The past couple of years have been an exercise in survival and learning on the fly. My Mom passed away. I learned how to be an executor and hunt down financial and medical records, deal with lawyers, insurance companies and financial institutions. I took on the responsibility of handling a special needs trust for one of my sisters. I’ve had to learn to deal with social security, trust investments, accounting and the complex legalities governing the trust. And I left my miserable job and started learning to code. Should have been easy after all that other stuff, right? Yeah, right. My confidence was shattered by my last job. I’ve never worked in a place so toxic and damaging. Learning Ruby was an uphill battle because deep down, I didn’t believe I could. I wanted to give up, mourn for everything lost, and curl up in a ball. Thanks to support from Corinna and the Learn experts, I didn’t. Graduation is getting closer. Here are a few things I’ve learned along the way. 

Meditate. 

Coding does not lend itself well to rote memorization. Focus on concepts and patterns. 

You are not remaking the wheel. Look at what other people have written. Learn from it. 

Believe you can do this, or you won’t.

Quiz yourself. Repeatedly. 

Take notes by hand. 

Make flashcards.

Most of learning is just filtering out the background noise. Life happens. Commit. This important or you wouldn’t be here. 

Tough it out.

Ask for help.

Take breaks. You will be much more effective if you do. 

Meet people. Kvetch. 

Code. Fuck up. Fix. Repeat.

Trust the process. 

Trust yourself.
