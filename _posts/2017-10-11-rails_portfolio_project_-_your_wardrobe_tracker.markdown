I elected to build a better, more complex version of my Sinatra app for my Rails project. My project allows you to keep track of individual wardrobe items (with descriptions) and assign those items to multiple capsules that you can categorize by season, occasion, function or whatever you choose. A useful tool if you tend to forget what’s in your closet. 

Prepare, prepare, prepare. Before you start to play around with all those wonderful Rails generators, flesh out your project’s anticipated functionality and model relationships. It does save you time in the long run even if you end up changing things. I had to alter my model relationships multiple times as the project evolved, as it turns out, things were more complicated than I anticipated. Relationships, complicated? Who knew? 

I abandoned my first run at this project because I screwed it up to the point of diminishing returns. Round two was better until I was getting close to done and got good and stuck. Almost all the functionality was there except that I could not make the user capsules display correctly in the index and nested form new wardrobe item views. I spent a good part of three days testing out different code and changing model relationships before I finally caved and asked for a one-on-one. I stink at asking for help; my epitaph will say something like, no, really, I’m fine. A big shout out to Kevin for helping me get my project sorted. Remember one of the cardinal Learn rules: don’t wait too long to ask for help. Sheer frustration is a crappy learning tool.

Another realization also came out of this project, I need to review. I need to recommit and be social. I need to use the terminology. I need to finish this program. It will still take me forever to work through lessons and labs but I can get there. People will get sick, the idiot who lives above us may flood us out again but I can finish this. And get a decent job. And hopefully get some sleep.
