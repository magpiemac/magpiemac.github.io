The best advice I can give you on this project is don’t start anything until you have read through the instructions, explored the example gems thoroughly, and watched all the videos. It’s very tempting to dive right in. I began the project after reading the instructions and ended up starting over because there are so many great tips and coding examples in the videos. For example, if you run “bundle gem gem_name” in your command line, the bundler will set you up with the proper gem file structure that includes a basic MIT license and readme. This will save you some time and you can add files as needed. 

The hardest part for me (as usual) was getting around the mental block. My perfectionist brain occasionally shuts down when faced with something that I perceive as very challenging. Putting various Ruby lessons together in a cohesive project seems difficult at first. Just go step by step and don’t be afraid to take a break when you get stuck. Go back and look at your old labs and look at example gems. Remember Ruby patterns. If you are using the Learn IDE, it isn’t a bad idea to review the Github basics lesson and run through this tutorial https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1. Also take the time to review the Gems and Bundler lesson and the Kickstarter Scraping Lab code along if you haven’t already done so. 

After you watch the videos, review, and look at the example projects, decide which website you want to scrape. This can also be difficult if you are interested in tons of stuff. Try to select something that isn’t too complex, you can always add details later as you work on the project. 

Then, get to work. Just go ahead and eat the elephant. You can use the video of “Daily Deal” almost as a code along. Stop thinking about everything you need to do and letting it freak you out. I can hear you thinking…..
