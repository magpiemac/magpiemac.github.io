I've been a lot of things, history teacher, manager, salesperson, jewelry designer. At the moment I am a glorified Help Desk technician catering to the needs of politicians. It's time for a change, I need a career that will offer me a creative outlet and some flexibility without straying back into the ranks of middle management. So no more procrastination, I researched several Master's programs and what kind of jobs and salaries should result from getting another degree. The return on investment looked pretty dismal, invest a couple of years and in some cases over $35,000 to land a job paying little more than I am making now. As much as I love history and books, I love my financial solvency even more. 

My career in technology has been almost accidental and not without its issues. I've regarded it as a logical and necessary thing, not something I felt passion for or was formally educated to do. Software development was not on my radar until I stumbled across a blog by Laurence Bradford. Which led me to Skillcrush and then to Flatiron. I was not sure that programming was for me but I tried tutorials, read a ton, and blasted through Flatiron's initial Ruby on Rails lessons. Programming speaks to me. But I had to think about it. And would probably still be thinking about it if yet another life change hadn't come down the turnpike. So yes, now is the time. I am afraid of failing but here I am.
