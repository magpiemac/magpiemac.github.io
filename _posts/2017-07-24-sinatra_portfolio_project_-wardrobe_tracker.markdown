I chose to build a wardrobe tracking app after cleaning out my closet in preparation for a move. It is amazing how many black t-shirts I have. My app allows a user to create an account and add items (with descriptions) to their personal wardrobe. Users can also edit and delete their wardrobe items. 

Preparation is worth it. As always, it is best to start by making sure that you understand the project requirements and review related lessons. Take a detailed look at other students’ projects, decide what you want to build and then map your domain model and relationships. Don’t skip the mapping step. I was so ready to dive in that I got way, way ahead of myself and made a mess overcomplicating the relationships. Keep it simple for now, you can always add complexity after you have the bones of a working app. 

After the prep work is finished, check out the corneal gem (thank you, Brian Emory). It is a wonderful time saver. The corneal gem builds your initial file structure for you and can also set up your migrations. Don’t be afraid to make tweaks after the initial set-up. I removed the html from the view file names and made a few additions and deletions as I built out my app.

After you get the basics working, add the frills but don’t go overboard. It is so easy to keep trying new things and accidentally mess up good working code. I admit that I had to go back and simplify after I burned myself out on a few attempted features. In my next life, I am coming back with more time, patience, and money. 

The hardest part is submitting the project for review. I feel like there is always more I could do but the perfect is the enemy of the good. I’ve included some useful links below. Happy coding.
