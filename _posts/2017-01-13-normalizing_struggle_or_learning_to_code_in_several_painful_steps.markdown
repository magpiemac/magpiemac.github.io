Well, here we are. I’m back in the program after a break, I had to complete an arduous project and I chose to leave my job. So now learning to code is my full-time gig and it’s stressful. And a little lonely. There is a lot riding on my success and the hardest part of coding is getting use to failing. I come from an academic and work background that does not encourage mistakes. In coding, if you are not failing a few tests, something is very wrong. It is hard to get used to that idea without feeling like you are failing overall. And that you have no innate talent for coding. But, as Stephen King once said, “Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work.”

I’ve made it through CSS/HTML and am struggling a bit with Ruby but I have learned a few important things. It’s good to normalize struggle. Struggling does not mean failure, it means progress. Painful progress sometimes, but progress. Learning to code is more skill acquisition than academic learning. It requires different strategies like just sitting down and practicing. Commit to practicing for at least 20 minutes a day if you can, it helps cement the concepts. Look for patterns. Do periodic reviews of major concepts and syntax. And don’t be afraid to ask for help. I’d rather get a root canal than ask for help too often but you need to ask to succeed. Hang on to your curiosity and try to remember why you started learning to code in the first place.
